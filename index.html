		<h1  style="color:red;">Why saving time is important?</h1>
		
		<table>
		
		<tr>
		<td> <p style="color:white;">Time may be infinite in existence, but it is finite for human beings. Our physical existence can only last for so long<br>
		before we are gone. The oldest person alive today is 118 years old.The person who has lived the longest, verified in recorded history, has lived<br>
		to 122 years in France. The trick is to spend every minute as wisely as possible to live by our true calling in life, or what we value most.<br>		
		Here is an example: If a person named Janette loves helping others, is a people-person, and wants to have a good balance in life between work<br>
		and play. She is spending 11 to 12 hours of her day at work. After she goes home, does she spend most of the evening cleaning the home. After<br>
		taking care of the home, she sits to watch television programs. If Janette wants balance, wants more socialization, and spending time helping<br>
		others, is her dayorganized in such a way to help her live up to her true desires and wishes? The answer is "no." Janette is not living by her<br>
		true values because she is spending her time doing things that do not necessarily help her feelfulfilled. She does not have balance in life<br>
		because she works too much. Unless her job involves helping others, she is not giving herself enough time each day to doing good for others.<br>
		Unless her job involves interactingwith hundreds of people each day, she is not able to be her true self.The question is, how can Janette manage<br>
		her time better? How can she save time to be able to spend it on doing things that she truly values? Keep track of your time.“What gets measured <br>
		gets done.” Though experts debate whowrote this old adage, few disagree with its wisdom. By measuring your time, you can evaluate whether you’re <br>
		spending it wisely. Otherwise, how could you identify areas that need adjustment? Focus on your time-wasters one by one.Once you get over the shock<br>
		of how many minutes you waste, you can reappropriate where it will do more good. As you check your progress regularly, your steady improvement will<br>
		motivate you to eliminate even more time-wastingpractices. According to bestselling author Kevin Daum, you will benefit from measuring your time for<br>
		as short a period as a week or a day.

		<h1  style="color:yellow;">How to save time</h1>
		
		<h2 style="color:white;">1. Keep track of your time.</h2>
		<p style="color:white;">“What gets measured gets done.” Though experts debate who wrote this old adage, few disagree with its wisdom. By measuring your time, you can evaluate whether you’re spending it wisely. Otherwise, how could you identify areas that need adjustment? Focus on your time-wasters one by one. Once you get over the shock of how many minutes you waste, you can reappropriate where it will do more good. As you check your progress regularly, your steady improvement will motivate you to eliminate even more time-wasting practices. According to bestselling author Kevin Daum, you will benefit from measuring your time for as short a period as a week or a day.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:white;">2. Amp up your downtime.</h2>
		<p style="color:white;">Do you commute on a form of public transportation? Do you find waiting rooms boring? If you have a smartphone, you can use this unoccupied time to your advantage. Think of your shortest daily tasks. When you have a long wait ahead of you, such as a doctor’s appointment, come prepared. Take what you need to work while you wait, and you will be free for other activities later.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:white;">3. Dedicate a distraction-free zone.</h2>
		<p style="color:white;">One super-productive overseas plane ride inspired Bryan Guido Hassin, CEO of a global technology startup, to incorporate “plane days” into his schedule. He puts his phone and laptop on airplane mode, disabling the network connections. He lets his coworkers know that he will be as unavailable as if he were out of the office. Then, he tackles his highest priority work. You may not have the luxury to make each day a “plane day,” but surely you can turn off your phone and shut your office door to gain a few uninterrupted moments.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:white;">4. Do one thing at a time.</h2>
		<p style="color:white;">Multitasking will cost you 40 percent of your productivity, according to behavioral psychologist Susan Weinschenk. The problem is, you think you’re doing two activities simultaneously, but you’re actually switching rapidly from one activity to another. Switches last a fraction of a second, but over the course of a day, those seconds add up to a significant loss of time. You also make more errors and inhibit your creativity when you multitask. Instead, block off an hour or two to concentrate on your most important task. Can’t sit still for an hour? Set a timer for fifteen minutes, then force yourself to focus until it sounds.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:white;">5. Learn from the best (and the worst).</h2>
		<p style="color:white;">Experience is a great teacher, but you can learn from other people’s successes and failures as well as our own. Rather than lose hours in research, ask friends for the pros and cons of services or products that they’ve bought. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel or the flying saucer camera. It’s simple; copy the methods of successful people and avoid the ways of the unsuccessful.</p>
